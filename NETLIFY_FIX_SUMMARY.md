# Netlify Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The Netlify build was failing with the following error:

```
Can't redefine existing key at row 11, col 19, pos 224:
10:
11> [build.environment]
                      ^
12:   # Ensure proper Node.js version
```

## Root Cause

The `netlify.toml` file had duplicate environment variable definitions:

1. **Line 9**: `environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18" }` (inline format)
2. **Lines 11-13**: `[build.environment]` section with `NODE_VERSION = "18"` (section format)

This created a conflict where the same key (`NODE_VERSION`) was being defined twice in different
formats within the same build configuration.

## Fix Applied

Removed the duplicate inline environment definition and kept only the cleaner section-based format:

### Before (Problematic):

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18" }  # ❌ Duplicate

[build.environment]  # ❌ Conflict with above
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--production=false"
  CI = "true"
```

### After (Fixed):

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]  # ✅ Single, clean definition
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--production=false"
  CI = "true"
```

## Verification

- ✅ **Local Build Test**: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ **Configuration Syntax**: No duplicate keys or conflicts
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly defined in single section
- ✅ **Netlify Deployment**: Ready for successful deployment

## Next Steps

1. Commit the fixed `netlify.toml` file
2. Push to the repository
3. Trigger a new Netlify deployment
4. The build should now complete successfully

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains all the original functionality
- Node.js version 18 is still enforced
- All performance and security headers remain intact
- SPA routing redirects are preserved
- Asset caching configurations are unchanged
